### üìù Differences from Original

1. **Ashoka Emblem**: Created a simplified SVG representation as the official emblem was not provided. In production, replace with the official Government of India Ashoka emblem.

2. **Fonts**: Using Inter font from Google Fonts. If the original uses a different font, it can be updated in the CSS.

3. **Backend Integration**: All form submissions are mocked with client-side validation. In production, these should connect to actual API endpoints:
   - Aadhaar verification API
   - Official portal authentication API
   - Statistics data API

4. **Favicon**: Placeholder favicon.ico included. Should be replaced with actual favicon generated from the logo.

5. **Images**: No background images were provided. The design uses CSS gradients to achieve similar visual effects.

### üîÑ Mock Data

The following elements use static/mock data that should be connected to real APIs:
- "20k+ Comments" statistic
- Form submission endpoints
- User authentication flow
- Session management

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Notes

- **CSS Architecture**: Uses CSS custom properties (variables) for easy theming
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JS with no dependencies for maximum compatibility
- **Performance**: Includes both development and minified production versions
- **Browser Support**: Works on all modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)
